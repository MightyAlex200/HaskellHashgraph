# Hashgraph implementation in Haskell

This repository contains an implementation of the Hashgraph distributed byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm written in Haskell.
The algorithm is patented by Leemon Baird and Swirlds. The whitepaper can be found [here](http://www.swirlds.com/downloads/SWIRLDS-TR-2016-01.pdf).

This implementation is not official and is probably complete garbage right now. Use at your own risk.
